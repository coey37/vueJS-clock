A simple service to allow people to safely trade skins for PayPal money.

## How does it work?
A user will be chatting with someone they would like to trade with from a skin to PayPal. But you can't trust them to definitely send the money over PayPal. Both users will have an account, the user with the skin will select a skin they would like to trade. From this they can select an amount of points they want for this skin. They then send this deal to the receiving user. If the user accepts the deal it continues otherwise the deal is cancelled. Now this deal is in place for the next 24 hours. So how do we safely transport the skin avoiding a trade ban and guaranteeing money? Once the user trading the skin has sent the skin, they can click to check if the skin is in the receiving user's inventory and if it is the user will be rewarded with the points the user was willing to trade for. These points can be bought or paid out via PayPal.
